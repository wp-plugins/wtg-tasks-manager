Task management with a plan - this plugin will grow to meet the needs of online business managed within WordPress.

== Description ==

Released 2014 and created to manage over 100 projects. The project has a design plan which may take until 2016 to complete
due to some specifications involving integration with plugins not even created yet. Use of Google Docs and other
cloud services is planned. I have a long list of features that will make WTG Tasks Manager more than just a fancy todo list.
Right now the plugin is in-line with most task manager plugins for WordPress but I need more. So you can bet it will grow
as my business grows. I will be using it daily and whenever I need it to do more I'll make it do more.

= Feature List = 

Remember this plugin is a beta so the list will be short for a while.                                
   
1. Use WYSIWYG editor to describe tasks in detail.
1. Tasks are made as a custom post type.
1. Every post box can be added to the Dashboard as a widget.     
 
== Installation ==

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I import tasks from a .csv file? =
You can import tasks to WTG Tasks Manager from a .csv file using my CSV 2 POST plugin. Tasks in this plugin are
simply posts and CSV 2 POST allows the creation of posts for custom post types. Please use my forum to get help
on this subject.

Thank you for considering WTG Tasks Manager. 

== Version Numbers and Updating ==

Explanation of versioning used by myself Ryan Bayne. The versioning scheme I use is called "Semantic Versioning 2.0.0" and more
information about it can be found at http://semver.org/ 

= Summary =

These are the rules followed to increase the WTG Tasks Manager plugin version number. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

= When To Update = 

Browse the changes log and decide if an update is required. There is nothing wrong with skipping version if it does not
help you - look for security related changes or new features that could really benefit you. If you do not see any you may want
to avoid updating. If you decide to apply the new version - do so after you have backedup your entire WordPress installation 
(files and data). Files only or data only is not a suitable backup. Every WordPress installation is different and creates a different
environment for WTG Task Manager - possibly an environment that triggers faults with the new version of this software. This is common
in software development and it is why we need to make preparations that allow reversal of major changes to our website.
